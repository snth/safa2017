## centiBils: A unit for Multi-Period Investment Performance Analysis

### Abstract

    Percentage Returns are the de-facto standard for Investment Performance Measurement.
    Yet they are not very well suited for multi-period performance evaluation. As an
    illustrative example, does the sequence (-30%, +40%) represent a positive or negative
    overall return? We review some of the problems with using percentage returns such as the
    lack of symmetry, lack of additivity and differences between the arithmetic and geometric
    means. We then introduce a new logarithmic unit modeled on the deciBel, tentatively
    called a centiBil, which addresses these shortcomings. Finally we conclude by using 
    centiBils to compare the performance of US Stocks, Bonds and Bills since 1927 and show
    how their use simplifies multi-period comparisons.
